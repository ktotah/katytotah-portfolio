                        <p>Hi! My name is Katy Totah and I've always been interested in learning how to code. In my time as an undergraduate student at Columbia University, I never got around to exploring coding - so I am really glad that I'm able to learn full stack web development through this special program via Columbia. As of right now in the course we have covered HTML and CSS, and we're just beginning to explore JavaScript. I hope that, in making this site, I'm able to demonstrate my newfound skills in HTML and CSS... and I will hopefully get to further enhance this page in the future as I acquire more coding skills! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
