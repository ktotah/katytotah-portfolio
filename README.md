# Katy Totah's Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio presents my journey and achievements as a budding web developer. It's crafted to showcase my coding skills and projects in an accessible, responsive design that caters to diverse devices and users.

### Motivation:
My curiosity in technology and eagerness to create intuitive, user-friendly applications drove me to delve into web development, leading to this project.

### Purpose:
The purpose of building this portfolio was to challenge myself to step outside my comfort zone, apply my learning in a tangible way, and to provide a platform where I can share my projects with the world. Another purpose for this project was to practice using CSS and enhance my comfortabiliy with this coding language. 

### Problem Solving:
In creating this portfolio, I navigated through various design and development challenges, focusing on responsive design and accessibility to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices and for all users. Flexbox became a cornerstone for layout design, addressing numerous challenges in structuring content. It allowed me to craft a flexible and responsive interface, adapting seamlessly across various devices while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

### Learning Outcomes:
Throughout this project, I've greatly enhanced my proficiency in CSS (as well as proficiency in HTML), expanding my CSS toolkit to include pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. These tools were instrumental in implementing the nuanced visual details and ensuring consistency throughout the site's styling. Overall, I feel much more comfortable using CSS, as building this site was a great way for me to play with and practice the language.
